title: "What I Offer"
intro: >
  With 15 years of experience in complex software projects and a strong theoretical foundation
  (B.Sc. Mathematics, M.Sc. AI in progress), I bridge algorithms and industrial practice.
  I focus on solutions that scale and stay technology-flexible: fluent in the Azure ecosystem,
  and equally efficient with open-source stacks to maximize independence.
